* **Linting** — Configured via `eslint.config.js`. To extend or enforce additional rules, update this file.
* **Vite Plugins** — Uses either `@vitejs/plugin-react` (Babel) or `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for Fast Refresh support ([GitHub][1]).
* **TypeScript Support** — For stricter linting and typing, consider migrating to the official TS template as recommended by Vite ([GitHub][1]).
